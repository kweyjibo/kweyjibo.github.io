The interface appears in the user's feed and facilitates tailoring an advertising campaign to meet their individual needs. Other functions included the ability to monitor statistical feedback. Produced in collaboration with a UX designer and backend developer the final product was well received.</p><p>ONLINE SHOPPING MALL<br>Another major project was my development of an interface for an integrated ecommerce platform.
