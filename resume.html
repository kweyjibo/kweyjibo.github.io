            Summary
        </div>

        <div class="summary_tx">
            <p>
                I am a frontend engineer with over 12 years varied experience.
            Having recently moved to The Netherlands I am open to exploring
            new opportunities, preferably ones with different challenges and
            allowing me to develop my skills further.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy creating rich visual components and animations, 
                working in collaboration with designers and participating in discussions around visual design.
                I'm looking for a position where I could continue growing in that direction.

                        <span class="bold">Odnoklassniki</span> Is a social network with more than 200 million registered users mostly
                        located in the Russian speaking world. There are 8 million unique daily visitors. I developed integrated components
                        for the desktop and mobile versions.

                        ADVERTISING MANAGER<br/>
                        I was given an open brief to develop an advertising manager function.
                        The interface appears in the user's feed and facilitates tailoring an advertising campaign
                        to meet their individual needs. Other functions included the ability to monitor statistical
                        feedback. Produced in collaboration with a UX designer and backend developer the final product was well received.

                        ONLINE SHOPPING MALL<br/>
                        Another major project was my development of an interface for an integrated ecommerce platform. This provides a catalogue of goods, 
                        iltered searches, a shopping cart, and an interface for processing orders with delivery and payment requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>PROMOTION & GAME PROJECTS <br/>
                        I produced small applications to enable the purchase of OK’s online virtual gifts. 
                        Further, I enjoyed making animated promotions for some major external companies. 
                        Using the React framework I completed several games to engage the interest of users.</p>
                    <p>
                        It has been a great and very varied experience working for a company with such a major online presence. 
                        My projects have run from the very first photographic module, through introducing email-markup,
                        also conducting code review, and configuring A/B testing and much more. 
                        I believe I have demonstrated my adaptability by supporting a variety of other teams.
